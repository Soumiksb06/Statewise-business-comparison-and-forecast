### Authorized and Paid up capital:
- Authorized Capital: Authorized capital, also known as authorized share capital, authorized stock, or authorized capital stock, refers to the maximum amount of share capital that a company is legally allowed to issue as stated in its memorandum of association or its articles of incorporation.
    - “Allowed to issue” in terms of authorized capital means that a company has the legal permission to issue a certain number of shares up to the maximum limit set by its authorized capital. This limit is specified in the company’s constitutional documents, such as the memorandum of association1. The company can issue shares up to this limit to raise funds from shareholders.
    
    
- Issued Capital: However, the actual number of shares issued, known as issued capital, may be less than the authorized limit to provide flexibility for future financing needs or to maintain control over the company’s ownership. This is the total value of shares that a company has actually issued to shareholders. It represents the portion of the authorized capital that has been allocated to shareholders and may include both fully paid and partially paid shares


- Paid-Up Capital: This is the amount of issued capital that shareholders have fully paid for. It does not include any portion of the issued capital that remains unpaid.

(Partially paid shares are shares that have been issued by a company to shareholders who have paid only a portion of the issue price upfront. The remaining amount can be paid in installments when the company makes a call for further payment123.

This arrangement is useful for both the company and the investor:

For the company, it allows them to secure capital immediately while giving them the flexibility to call for the remaining funds as needed for growth or operations.
For the investor, it provides the opportunity to invest without committing the full amount upfront, which can be beneficial if the investor does not have all the funds available immediately or prefers to spread out the financial commitment.
The rights of partially paid shareholders are generally the same as those of fully paid shareholders, including the right to receive dividends, vote at shareholders’ meetings, and participate in the winding up of the company. However, the rights to dividends and voting may be proportional to the amount paid in.)
